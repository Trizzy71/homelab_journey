I got a lot done today! I finalized my Proxmox installation on the Bellink s12. Set up automatic backups, as well as migrating to the no-subscription repository and away from the enterprise options. I spun up HA in a VM but didn't want to deal with migrating my devices from the guest network. Also spun up a Minecraft server that works beautifully! Soon I will focus on my second machine, the Zimaboard 2. I want to install TrueNAS Scale on it and get some of the services I used to have running back up again.
